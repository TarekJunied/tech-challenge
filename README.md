# Alpamayo Tech Assessment

Welcome to the **Alpamayo Tech Assessment**!

This challenge is a chance to show us how you think and solve problems. It’s not about knowing everything or writing tons of code—it’s about being resourceful and creative. 

### What You Need to Know
- The whole assessment should take about an hour, for sure **no more than 2 hours**.
- Each part is designed to take **30 minutes or less**.
- You can use **Google, chatbots, or any tools** to help with questions about technologies or databases.
- We don’t expect you to know all the tools we use, just to figure out how to work with them.
